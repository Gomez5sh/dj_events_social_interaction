# Web App to Manage events and social interaction for DJ’S

> _"Here, Everyone Listens to you"_

When you start as a Dj the most difficult thing is to make yourself known, and it is always good to manage your image through all social networks, however in a world so marked by trends, it is complicated to make yourself known, and more so with so many different social networks, so we decided to create a single site, where you can promote your events achieving not only that more people see you, but to be able to organize your time and events. You can also make yourself known by placing your muisca and pictures of events.
